## 📝 Project Description
This project is a Machine Learning application built with **Python** and **Streamlit** that predicts the outcomes of UEFA Champions League matches. By analyzing historical match data and in-game statistics, the model forecasts whether a match will result in a Home Win, Draw, or Away Win.

## 🚀 How It Works?
The application uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on comprehensive match statistics, including:
* Ball Possession (%)
* Total Shots & Shots on Target
* Passing Accuracy
* Goalkeeper Saves
* Corner Kicks & Fouls

## ✨ Key Features
* **🎮 Full Control Scenario Mode:** Users can manually input specific match statistics (e.g., "What if Arsenal has 70% possession but 0 shots?") to see how the AI adjusts its prediction.
* **📅 Auto-Fixture Prediction:** Automatically loads upcoming Champions League fixtures and predicts results based on team season averages.
* **🛡️ Smart Validation:** Includes error handling to prevent unrealistic inputs (e.g., total possession > 100%).
